### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Youssef
#### Aspiring Cybersecurity Professional
I am an aspiring Cybersecurity professional transitioning from a successful background in customer service and call center operations. My previous role equipped me with exceptional problem-solving skills, effective communication, and a customer-focused mindset, all of which I now bring to my journey into the world of cybersecurity.

Currently, I hold the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certification and have completed foundational courses in Cyber Defense, Networking Fundamentals, and System Security. My learning path includes hands-on practice on platforms like TryHackMe, where I am building practical skills in network security, threat analysis, and defensive strategies.
